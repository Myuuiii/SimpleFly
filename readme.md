# SimpleFly

A very, very simple Minecraft plugin that lets you enable flight for yourself.

## Commands

`/fly` - Toggle flight. (This can only be used for yourself at the moment).

## Permissions

`flying.allow` - Allows the player with the permission to use the `/fly` command.

## Roadmap

-   [ ] Add arguments to `/fly` command so you can enable/disable flight for others.
-   [ ] Add a new permission for toggling other's flight.
